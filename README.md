Assumption
* Using fixed URL in this project. In real world, it should be constructed based on the userID or other variables.
* I assume the formatting of date and phone number is not the focus of this project. Didn't spend too much time on making it work for all countries or dealing errors.
* I assume the purchase list API should be called every time users click the purchase button, so doesn't cache the result.
